    The purpose of a camp is to come together for a weekend to train and focus deeply on a certain topic.
    There are members of different shotokai-clubs in the camps from all over Finland. The camps are arranged
    on Spring and on Autumn, and Solvalla Main Camp in Summer. Dan-gradings take place on the main camp.
