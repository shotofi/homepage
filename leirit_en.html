  <h1>CAMPS</h1>
  
  <p>
    Camps/Weekend courses are arranged during the school year usually at least once a month and one additional 
    camp is held during the summer. The course fee for one weekend camp is usually 20 euros or about 60 euros 
    for courses held by a foreign (imported) teacher. To attend camps you have to have paid your yearly membership 
    fee of 20 euros to Suomen Karate-Do-Shotokai (SKDS).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Solvalla long weekend course is held at the end of May. It is the main event of finnish Shotokai and 
    Shoto-Budo clubs. The course fee is about 130 euros for SKDS members (170 euros for non-members) but 
    slightly less than half of it is usually reimbursed by the club for those that attend. The course fee 
    includes breakfast, dinner, lodging and three training sessions per day. A separate letter is sent about 
    the camp details each spring to members of SKDS.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can participate in the camps and weekend courses after completing the
    <a href="alkeiskurssi_en.html" title="Info about the beginner's course">beginner's course</a>.
    You can try to graduate during the camps by informing about your intent at the start 
    of the camp at the latest and by paying the graduation fee of 10 euros.
    New grades are announced during the first regular practice session after the camp.
