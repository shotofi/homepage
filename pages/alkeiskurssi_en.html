  <p>
    The essence of the <a href="../tyylikuvaus_en.html" title="Style description">Shotokai-style</a> is movement.
    The point of the practice is not so much the repetitious 
    practice of singular details but to develope a usable body.
    This takes concentration and knowing your own body.
    The style does not include any competitions.
    We don't demand knowledge in terminology but you'll soon be familiar with
    the most common terms.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Take loose exercise clothing with you already to the first practice.  You don't necessarily have
    to be in particularly good basic condition as you'll be able to get in shape during the course.  
    A karate uniform (gi) is not obligatory during the beginner's course.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are no locks in changing rooms in Pohjoinen Hesperiankatu, so it is advised to bring your 
    own padlock. Alternatively, you can take you valuables to training hall during the practices.
