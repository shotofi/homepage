    <h2>DOJO ETIQUETTE</h2>
  </header>

  <h3>General</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Feet shall be washed and dried before entering the dojo, and one should wear e.g. sandals
      while walking from changing room to training hall. It is not allowed to wear shoes while
      practicing on tatami.
    </li>
    <li>
      Arrive on time. However, if you arrive late, wait silently on the door of the training hall
      while others are on the line. Come in only after others have stood up.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn off your cellular phone before practices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bow on the door while entering or leaving the training hall.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bow to new parter when starting on finishing a practice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clean floor or tatami if it is necessary. Blood stains must be removed immediately.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are no practices after our practice, close windows and doors and turn off lights when practices are over.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Safety regulations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The most important point while practicing is safety: everyone is responsible of himself or herself and of his or hers training partner.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because our training curriculum is quite large and we have many instructors, it is imperative that you do techniques with
      reasonable tempo, especially if the techniques are new to you. Leave your ego outside and practice in peace.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not leave practice, not even go to WC, without telling the instructor beforehand.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep your finger- and toenails short. Remove jewellery, rings, watches, piercing etc. before practices. If it is not
      possible to remove piercings, put some tape over them. Do not keep long hair open.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have some handicaps, which prevent you from doing something, inform instructors beforehand.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Training dictate</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have a humble and open attitude, and be happy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Focusing opens doors, cooperation takes you further.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inner silence brings balance.
    </li>
  </ul>
