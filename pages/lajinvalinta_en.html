  <p>
  Since most people, when asked this, would suggest their own art, I'll
  try to throw in some general advice:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li> In <b>shows</b> you may get some idea of an art, but
         most clubs try to make their shows as tempting and flashy as
         possible, and give a pretty inaccurate picture of their style.
         A more efficient way of getting an idea of what a style is
         about, is to <b>watch their normal
         practices</b>. Preferably, check out practices for
         different levels.  Since this takes a lot of time, you should
         first limit the possible styles into a few interesting ones by
         other criteria. </li>

    <li> Choosing carefully the style may not be as important as
         <b>where and with whom</b> you would practise.  Also,
         if you really want to get into practising, it means suprisingly
         lot what the <b>conditions at the dojo</b> are like
         (big mats, good showers), what the people are like towards each
         other (nice or rude, etc), and <b>how will you travel
         there</b>.  Also the <b>prices</b> may count.
         The most expensive ones may not be the best, although all the
         expensive ones aren't just business, either (sometimes it costs
         a lot to have good equipment, which probably shows in the
         fees). The <b>practice times</b> may also affect your
         decision, i.e. which days and what time of the day you can and
         want to practise.</li>

    <li> You don't have to be in the shape of your life to start most
         arts. You will get into condition if you're willing to work on
         it.  However, it is a good idea to spend some time on thinking
         whether you have some <b>special limitations</b>,
         like back or joint problems (or a bad near-sightedness, for
         example -- I [Merja] myself train Aikido with my glasses on,
         but Judo I would not even consider).</li>

    <li> Are you <b>interested in competing?</b> Do you want
         to learn <b>weapon techniques</b> as well? Would you
         definitely like to learn punches, kicks, locks, throws etc, or
         is it ok if something is left out?  Answers to these questions
         will limit the amount of arts or styles considerably. </li>

    <li> Do you prefer <b>b discipline</b> or can't you
         stand authorities? This may rather be typical to each club or a
         sensei than to a style or art. I, for example, would not like
         practise an art where you have to do 10 push-ups if you smile
         at the wrong time, but some people prefer it more army-style. Go
         and check the practices, and you'll see if you
         like the degree of discipline.  Even if you aren't fond of
         strict rules etc, a very chaotic way of practising may be
         dangerous. </li>
  </ul>

  When you answer these questions in your mind, you'll probably be able
  to limit the selection to a few styles at most.  And whichever you
  choose, it is very likely that the more you learn, the more you
  enjoy. On the other hand, switching styles or arts, or even practising
  two arts at the same time is not to be feared.
