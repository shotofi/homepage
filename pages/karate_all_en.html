    <h2>JOIN MAILING LIST</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    The mailing list is foremost meant for Shoto ry announcements and other such local use. The list readers are Shoto ry
    members and others interested in the topics discussed on the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    No one is responsible for writting announcements and info to the list and because of this if any list member thinks
    that he or she has information that might interest the list readers, this member is most welcome to share this information.
