  <h1>Karate-do Shotokai style and our club</h1>
  <p>
    Peter Nystén (<img class="email" src="/images/emails/email-peter.png" />),
    the main instructor of our club describes our club, our practices and the Shotokai style:
  </p>

  <h2>About our club</h2>
  <p>
    Our club members are mainly students from the University of Helsinki and the Helsinki University of Technology . We have practices four to five times per week depending on how we are able to get practice halls, the practices lasts normally 1,5 hours. The Shotokai practice in Helsinki started in 1973. Our national organization (Finnish Karate-Do Shotokai; Suomen Karate-Do Shotokai r.y.) arranges national weekend courses once a month and invites teachers from abroad about three times each year. These international training sessions range from three to five days at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Shotokai originating karate-do practice in Europe is nowadays spread into several organizations. Our organization have active contacts today with three of them. Originally we practiced with M. Harada Sensei until the end of the eighties.The teachers we use have different approaches to karate, ranging from kumite (sparring)/practical orientated to theoretical. So, our practices are also somewhat varying in content, but we are trying to benefit from the differing perspectives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The club is financed mostly by its members. The club makes no profit and pays no compensations for its teachers. The club promotes taking part in national and international courses within our organizations by supporting travel costs and course payments for its members.
  </p>

  <h2>Our practices</h2>
  <p>
    The practices within different Shotokai clubs in Finland vary somewhat, and so the following description is about our club, but to some degree also applies to other Shotokai clubs in Finland.
  </p>

  <h2>Kata</h2>
  <p>
    In our club we esteem kata (practice of technique forms; no partner, often performed in groups) practice high with its implications on body feeling, use of low gravity etc. We place great importance in the ability to move in harmony with our practice partners both in kata and in several moving exercises. We also practice those techniques from kata which seem to be practical.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way we practice kata could maybe be described as somewhere between T'ai Chi and Shotokan in the eyes of a spectator. Katas are performed with different paces, from very slow to full speed. Often the pace is chosen so that the feeling of using hip movement and appropriate breathing in the techniques is possible. Different practice items are emphasized in kata training.
  </p>

  <h2>Kihon</h2>
  <p>
    In kihon (practice of basic techniques) we train not only against air but also on punching pads and other practice equipment. Tameshiwari (breaking boards etc.) is practically nonexistent. In kihon kumite (kihon with a partner) we train moving, distancing, rythm and the various techniques. Long series performed with a partner (e.g. ward off, hit, kick, take to the ground, lock) are not common except in some katas designed for pairs. The practice also includes techniques for releasing of basic holds etc.
  </p>

  <h2>Kumite (sparring)</h2>
  <p>
    Our practice includes also jyu kumite (free sparring) and prearranged kumite forms, but we do not have any competitions. We see the several kumite type practices as a way to benefit mutually with your training partner. There is no showing off, we think that the karate practices should always be something positive for all members, regardless of their age and other attributes.
  </p>

  <h2>Stretching and health</h2>
  <p>
    It goes without saying that warming up, streching etc. exercises are an integral part of the practices; the well being of the practitioners is naturally of prime importance to us.
  </p>

  <h2>Gradings</h2>
  <p>
    The grading after 3. kyu (green belt) take place always on national / international courses in order to be able to check the level of the candidate against the national / international level.
  </p>

  <h2>About Karate-Do Shotokai style</h2>
  <p>
    The way Shotokai performs kata and also the basic techniques is based on the same Funakoshi Sensei teaching as for the Shotokan style. We have the same katas and use the same names for techniques. The "classical" practice methods are based on the same frame (sambon kumite, tenno kata...).
  </p>
  <p>
    The way our karate differs from many other karate styles lays not so much in form, but more in content. We donŽt think of kiai and the tensing of muscles in the same way as most of the other karate styles. We believe that the body should be in a relaxed state; the body knows itself which muscles are needed. The way we think of e.g. oi-tsuki (straight lunge punch) is based mostly on the "classical" approach as interpreted by Harada Sensei and later partly on the effects on punching pads. When punching, we donŽt tense our muscles at the point of contact but try to punch through the target somewhat. If a contact is not made, then there is a natural contracting of the muscles in order to stop the technique. The techniques are based on hips, this requires a solid but pliable stance in the basic technique.

  <h2>General stuff</h2>
  <p>
    Smooth and large movements and stressing relaxed moving are typical features of Shotokai style practising. On the other hand, competition isn't. We don't enforce a b discipline. Our practitioners are mainly adults, and it is up to them to conduct themselves in a way that they and others can learn. We think that a friendly and supporting atmosphere is important for learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Competition is not part of Shotokai style karate. We don't emphasis graduations and belts. Graduations take place on national courses, when the instructors consider that the practitioner is ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the practices may be pretty demanding both mentally and physically, it is very important that the training atmosphere is good. This means considering other people: there are no enemies or people to compete with in the practices, there are only practise partners, from whom you may learn, and whose development you can support. Especially when two people with different skill level practise together, it is important to train on a level that the other one is not completely lost and frustrated because of it. It's best if you can then train your partner barely at the limits of her abilities -- that's where most learning takes place -- and extend those limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>By attempting to develop those below you, you will ensure that you'll have plenty of good practise partners in the future, to learn from.</b>
  </p>

  <h2>Some history of the style</h2>
  <p>
    On the Shotokai founders lineage you will find names such as Funakoshi,
    Egami and Hironishi.  The closest style to Shotokai from the historical
    perspective is <em>Shotokan</em>, which was also founded by some of
    Funakoshi's students. We still have many very similar katas with similar
    names, although the emphasis in the practices is different.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shotokai is a rather small style (by number of people practising), and it
    is practised nowadays at least in the following countries:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Algeria </li>
    <li> Austria </li>
    <li> Belgium </li>
    <li> Canada </li>
    <li> Chile </li>
    <li> England </li>
    <li> Finland </li>
    <li> France </li>
    <li> Gibraltar </li>
    <li> Greece </li>
    <li> Italy </li>
    <li> Japan </li>
    <li> Mexico </li>
    <li> Portugal </li>
    <li> Scotland </li>
    <li> Spain </li>
    <li> USA </li>
    <li> Yugoslavia </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The style arrived to Finland around late sixties or early seventies, and
    nowadays there are clubs belonging to SKDS (Suomen Karate Do Shotokai,
    i.e. Finland's KDS) in the following cities:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Helsinki (instructor Peter Nystén) </li>
    <li> Kuusankoski (Juha 'Jussi' Salmi) </li>
    <li> Kuusamo (Kimmo Niikkonen) </li>
    <li> Oulu () </li>
    <li> Posio (Kari Kuitunen) </li>
    <li> Rovaniemi (Juhani Salminen) </li>
    <li> Salo (Risto Kemppainen, Janne Urpo) </li>
    <li> Taivalkoski (Mika Määttä) </li>
    <li> Turku (Pekka Venäläinen, Yrjö and Anu Luukkanen) </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In addition, there are groups outside of SKDS practising at least in
    Vaasa and Kuusankoski.

  <h2>What our practices are like</h2>

  <p>
    A typical practice lasts for 1,5 hours and starts with a 20-minute
    warm-up. Rest of the practice contains <b>kata</b>,
    <b>kumite</b> (sparring) and <b>kihon</b> (practising
    single techniques such as kicks, punches and locks).
  </p>
  <p>
    During the past 10 years our practices have changed somewhat.  In the
    earlier times, there were more practices concentrating on moving, timing,
    the ability to follow and wholly concentrate on your partner.  The goal
    was to achieve a perfect body condition, not only in the physical sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kumite, and especially free sparring, was almost never practised.  It was
    thought that the ability to fight would come by itself, once the body
    condition was correct.  This method or practising was mainly influenced by
    what we gained from Harada-sensei's teachings back in the eighties, and
    how those ideas have developed among ourselves and with Colin Reeve. (This
    all is not to say that Harada-sensei is or was against sparring,
    though.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Lately, we have started practising more and more also the kumite itself.
    We have not given up all the moving and following and other mind and body
    condition -centered practices, but it is no more the only practice method
    in use.
  </p>
  <p>
    We haven't practiced almost any weapon techniques.  However, we plan to
    add some <em>bo</em> practices in the near future.  Often we use pads to
    strike and kick on, to get more feel for the techniques, and to study the
    effectivity of different techniques, their direction, timing of applying
    the force, and what kind of body movement and condition must be used to
    make the technique most effective. By using pads for hitting practices we
    also prevent damaging the joints, which may be the result when punching
    hard in the air and locking the joints with force.  The pads are held in
    hand or against the stomach. Other than that, we don't wear protective
    gear, and in kumite the contact to the body is accordingly light (rather
    depending on the practitioner who is at the receiving end of the blow).
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last few years our practices have gained variety, and perhaps
    become more understandable.  The methods naturally develop all the time,
    hand in hand with the instructors' development and preferences.  For the
    same reason, even in different clubs of the same style, the practise
    emphasis may differ greatly: the instructors have different abilities and
    consider different things as important.  According to <a
      href="http://avocado.pc.helsinki.fi/~krista/">my</a> view,
    the best part of it all is to be able to sometimes practise also under the
    other instructors, on our <a href="leirit_en.html">national courses</a>.
    Then there's the opportunity to learn things from a slightly different
    angle than usual, and to gain a lot of insight.
