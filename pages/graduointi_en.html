    <h2>GRADING</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    Grading takes place on a camp or in own club's grading training. After green belt all gradings take place on camps.
    Grading on a camp always requires the trainee to take part in the entire camp. Taking part merely in the grading session
    is not enough since the trainee will be evalued during the whole camp.

  <p>
    One must discuss with instructors of our own club about grading before enrolling for grading, preferably by sending
    mail to <img class="email" src="/images/emails/email-ohjaajat.png" />. The price of grading is 10 euros, and it is paid only once for each rank.
